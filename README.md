# fizzbuzz
Written in *Python*

## Summary
Iterate through a set of integers and print "Fizz" if equally divisible by 3, "Buzz" if equally divisible by 5, or "FizzBuzz" if equally divisible by both 3 and 5.

## Instructions
When prompted, type in the total number of integer iterations desired and hit enter.
> Note: If the number has more than three digits (i.e., any number greater than 999) then a confirmation will be requested. Type "yes" and hit enter to continue.

The program should then iterate through each integer from 1 to the number selected, inclusive.
> Note: More options will be added soon for starting from a selected integer.

## About
This project is a personal spin on the popular programming exercise based on the children's game of the same name. For now, the program runs in Python, but alternatives may be added in the future.

A minimal version of the code can be found in the file "fizzbuzz-short.py", which generates the traditional FizzBuzz set from 1 to 100 in as few characters as possible.
