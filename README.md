# fizzbuzz
*Python*

## Summary
Iterate through a set of integers and print "Fizz" if equally divisible by 3, "Buzz" if equally divisible by 5, or "FizzBuzz" if equally divisible by both 3 and 5.

## Instructions
When prompted, type in the total number of integer iterations desired and hit enter.
> Note: If the number is five digits long or more (i.e., a number greater than 9999) then a confirmation will be requested. Type "yes" and hit enter to continue.

The program should then iterate through each integer from 1 to the number selected, inclusive.
> Note: More options will be added soon for starting from a selected integer.

## About
This project is a personal spin on the popular programming exercise based on the children's game of the same name. For now, the program runs in Python, but alternatives may be added in the future.
